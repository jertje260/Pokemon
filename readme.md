# Pokemon App

This Ionic App is a school assignment. I have made use of the following native components:
* Geolocation
* Compass/device orientation
* Sharing
* LocalStorage

## What does it do

This app basically is some sort of spin-off from the Pokémon Go App. You run around with the app open and every so many meters a Pokémon spawns. To capture the Pokémon you turn your phone 360 degrees. It should show how far you have turned by drawing a Pokéball.

The app also has a Pokédex with Pokémon from the first generation. Information & images of the Pokémon are loaded through the [PokéAPI](http://pokeapi.co/).

For the icons, I made use of Material Icons.
